# Usage

After creating a FakeTool project, let’s see how to use it in a real project.

---

## 1. Start development

Move into your project folder and start the dev server:

```bash copy
cd my-project
npm run dev
```

By default, the project will run at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## 2. Project structure

When you create a project with FakeTool, you’ll get a folder like this:

```json
my-app/
 ├── package.json
 ├── faketool.config.js
 └── src/
     └── index.js

```

## 3. Build for production

When you’re ready to deploy:

```bash copy
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized output in the dist/ folder.

## 4. Run in production

Serve the production build:

```bash copy
npm run start
```
