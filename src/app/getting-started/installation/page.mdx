To set up a **FakeTool** website manually, follow these steps:

---

## 1. Create a new project

Run the following command in your terminal to bootstrap a new FakeTool app:

This will generate a new folder my-app with the necessary files

## 2. Move into the project folder

After installation, you should see faketool listed in your package.json:

```bash copy
cd my-app
```

## 3. Install dependencies

```bash copy
npm install
```

## 4. Verify package.json

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "faketool": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```
