# Performance

CyWeb is designed with speed in mind. Whether you’re working in development or deploying to production, it ensures fast builds and smooth user experience.

---

## Development performance

- **Hot Reloading**  
  Any change you make is reflected instantly without restarting the server.

- **Minimal overhead**  
  CyWeb avoids unnecessary bundling during dev for faster feedback loops.

---

## Production performance

- **Code splitting**  
  Only the code that’s needed is loaded, reducing initial bundle size.

- **Automatic minification**  
  Your output is optimized by default with tree-shaking and dead code removal.

- **Caching**  
  Rebuilds are cached to speed up redeployment.

---

## Best practices

- Use the `--analyze` flag (`npm run build -- --analyze`) to inspect your bundle size.
- Keep an eye on third-party dependencies, as they often increase build size.
- Use [configuration](/config) options to control optimizations.
